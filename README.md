# Sleep-Disorder-Prediction-using-Lifestyle-Data

In the comprehensive analysis of lifestyle data, I conducted an in-depth exploration through Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset encompassed a multitude of crucial features, ranging from fundamental demographic information such as Age to intricate aspects like Physical Activity levels, Duration of Sleep, Quality of Sleep, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure, among others.

To derive meaningful insights from this rich dataset, I employed advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Logistic Regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification, was harnessed to unravel relationships and patterns within the data. This method allowed for the identification of key factors influencing specific outcomes or behaviors related to lifestyle.

Furthermore, the analysis delved into the realm of ensemble learning with the application of the Random Forest Classifier. This sophisticated ML algorithm excels in capturing intricate dependencies and interactions within the dataset, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between lifestyle variables.

The combination of these analytical approaches not only facilitated the identification of significant predictors but also contributed to the development of a robust predictive model. This model, trained on the diverse lifestyle dataset, not only enhances our comprehension of the intricate interplay between different factors but also serves as a valuable tool for making informed predictions and decisions based on new data.

The outcomes of this analysis hold the potential to inform interventions, policies, or personalized recommendations aimed at improving lifestyle choices, promoting better health, and fostering overall well-being. This holistic approach to data analysis and machine learning underscores the commitment to leveraging advanced methodologies for deriving actionable insights from complex lifestyle datasets.
